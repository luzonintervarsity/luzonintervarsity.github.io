# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

The purpose of this document is to acquaint you with the platforms we will use to host Luzon IV, as well as the protocols we have in place for rounds, ballots, and disconnection events. Please take the time to read through this well before the first day of prelims.

Also, a few reminders for everyone:

1. See if your data in the [participants list](https://luzonintervarsity.calicotab.com/liv2021/participants/list/), e.g. name and novice status, are correct.
2. Submit any conflicts in our [clash form](https://forms.gle/byw3vTx9uoaAKAu36) as soon as possible, specifically before 3rd November.
3. Join our Discord server and rename according to the provided convention.
4. Bookmark your private tab URL. If you do not have it yet, please contact me.
5. Double-check that your mic, audio, and Internet connection settings are functional.

See you in a few days!
