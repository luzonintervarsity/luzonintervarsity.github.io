### Step 3: Validate using your private code

Your private code is in the email where you found the link to this briefing. This is a string of eight characters that is unique to each participant. **_Do not share this with anyone._**

The final step is to use this code to validate your Discord account.
Head to the #register channel and enter in `?register <your private code>`.
