# Observer Policy

Observers and coaches may access the server by clicking the 👁️ button below the welcome message. They can read announcements and join debate rooms, but will not be able to speak or send messages in most channels.

For the safety of our participants, observers must follow the naming conventionm, `[Observer] <Name>`, using a recognizable name. OrgComm will routinely remove people who have not named themselves appropriately. Finally, observers may not stay in rooms where participants did not consent to be observed.
