# Tournament Platforms

### Discord

By default, all six preliminary rounds will be hosted on the Luzon IV Discord server. This can be negotiated if a team requests it, or if all teams in the room simply prefer another platform.&#x20;

All briefings and announcements from OrgComm and AdjCore will be made here so it is essential that, at minimum, you have a Discord account and can read the text channels.

### Zoom

Zoom is the default platform for outrounds. Zoom tends to demand more bandwidth, so teams may opt out and request to use Discord or Google Meet instead.
