# Break Eligibility

### Judges

Judges may be considered for the break if they judge at least four out of the six preliminary rounds.

### Ironperson policy

An ironperson is when a speaker does both speeches for their team in a round because their partner is unavailable. A team may only ironperson a maximum of two times to be break eligible.

### Novices

A novice is anyone who hasn't broken in the WSDC and any collegiate major tournament. A team must have two novice speakers to qualify for the novice breaks.
