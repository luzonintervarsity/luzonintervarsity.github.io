# Round Flow

### 1: Matchups are released

Each round starts with the release of matchups on the #matchups-and-motions channel. Participants are allocated a team position and a room. Note that only teams and judges who [check in](check-ins.md) for a particular round will be allocated.

### 2: AdjCore reveals the motion

15 minutes after matchups, the motion is announced live at the convening voice channel, then published on Tabbycat and the #matchups-and-motions channel. Teams are free to ask AdjCore to clarify certain parts of the motion in the #motion-clarifications channel.

### 3: Prep time starts

Teams have 15 minutes to prepare for the round. They may use the prep rooms in the server or wherever else they are comfortable with, as long as they are in their debate rooms once prep time has ended. Teams and judges that do not arrive on time will be subject to our [Disconnection Policy](disconnection-poicy.md).

### 4: Round proper

The chair calls the round to order and starts by introducing themself and their preferred pronouns, and inviting everyone else to do the same. If there are observers in the room, the chair must ask the speakers whether they consent to being observed.

### 5: Chair presides over deliberation then submits ballot after

When the round ends, judges convene in a separate room to deliberate, for a maximum of 15 minutes. Once deliberations end, the chair should [submit their ballot](ballots-and-feedback.md) as soon as possible.

### 6: Chair gives their oral adjudication speech

Finally, the chair returns to the room. If a representative of each team is present, the chair gives a 10-12 minute speech justifying the decision.

**_Note_**: If you are a chair please do NOT start the OA without first submitting your ballot. This is absolutely important for the tournament to run smoothly.

### 7: Teams and panelists grade the chair

Both speakers and panelists should submit feedback for their chair before heading back to the convening channel. Unsubmitted feedbacks will be called out!
